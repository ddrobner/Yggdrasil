/**
 * Abstracts a system which uses resourceLocks and has some task (recurring or
 * one-shot) to be performed. An example is PID control - monitor sensors
 * and periodically set motor values based on this. Pooled subsystems share a
 * common work queue, and so pooled subsystems should be careful to ensure that
 * their tasks do not contain long-running operations (which includes any Thread.sleeps,
 * Timers, while(true) loops, etc) or else other Subsystems will be unable to
 * execute until the long-running operation has completed. If you need a Subsystem
 * which is able to execute long-running operations without interfering with
 * other Subsystems, use an IndependentSubsystem.
