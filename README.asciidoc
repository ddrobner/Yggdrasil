== What is this?
Yggdrasil is the name of the reusable FRC Java libraries which FRC 3161 provides,
free of charge and open to any usage (as permitted by the BSD 2-clause license),
based upon the software developed by 3161 for the 2014 season. For more information
about the team, or the robot for which this code was originally written, please
visit link:http://team3161.ca[3161's Homepage].

Development for Yggdrasil happens on link:https://github.com/FRC3161/Yggdrasil[our GitHub].

Versions 0.8 and up are compatible with the 2015 FRC Control Systems Update
(or subsequent yearly updates - strict 2015 compatibility is not guaranteed) and
Java 8+. If for some reason you need to remain compatible with the previous Java
1.4 Micro Edition environment and the cRIO, you will need to use an older 0.2.x
version of Yggdrasil.

== Introduction
Yggdrasil is the name of the library which FRC 3161 uses and publishes for other
teams to use as they please.

This project is intended as a collection of reusable modules, with no specific
robot hardware configuration or design in mind. Each package provided by 3161 has
the prefix ca.team3161.lib, and all classes reside within these packages. Each
such class aims to have at least skeleton documentation explaining its purpose,
but for ease of reference and a high-level overview, this document will explain
the concepts behind the Yggdrasil libraries.

Please note that the basis of Yggdrasil was written in the cRIO days of FRC,
and many additions were added the first year that the RoboRIO was introduced.
At that time, (the author(s) felt that) WPILibJ was lacking functionality in
some ways or defined its various interfaces and classes in a way that made
extensibility difficult. More recent versions of WPILib have corrected many
of the perceived flaws from earlier years, so parts of Yggdrasil have become
redundant. These will eventually be marked as deprecated.

=== Building
Yggdrasil can be built by simply running `./gradlew build` in the root of this
project.

== Design
The design intended by these libraries are a main robot class, subclassed
from Titanbot, which defines the robot's behaviour in autonomous,
teleoperated, and disabled modes, in a manner very similar to the standard
IterativeRobot provided by FRC. This base class provides for a robot's
autonomous routine to be performed in a separate thread from the main robot
thread, allowing for a simpler, more straight-forward action scripting style,
without having to rely on myriad Timer objects.

Major component groups of the robot can be modelled as Subsystem subclasses,
which allows for components to be monitored and controlled in the background
by a new thread or a shared threadpool. This allows physical safety to be
ensured, for example, by having a background thread monitor a limit switch
to ensure that a motor controller shuts off, even if the main robot
class' logic fails to check for this condition.

== Other Libraries
Late in the 2014 season, 3161 forked Team 254's
link:https://github.com/Team254/CheesyVision[CheesyVision] library, and began
to experiment with using this functionality to enhance our own autonomous
routine with hotgoal detection. Parts of this forked repository are included
in this repository, as cheesyvision.py in the root and the src/com/team254
source directory. These have been modified from Team 254's originally published
versions.

=== Main package (ca.team3161.lib.robot)
The main, starting-point package.

==== TitanBot
A subclass of IterativeRobot. Autonomous is run in a new Thread,
leaving the main robot thread responsible (generally) solely for
handling FMS events, Watchdog, etc. This allows autonomous scripts
to use convenient semantics such as Thread sleeping rather than
periodically checking Timer objects. A method "waitFor" is supplied
which should be used in favour of Thread.sleep as it provides assurances
that the autonomous script will not run over the length of the autonomous
period. As a replacement for teleopPeriodic, the new method
teleopRoutine should be used. Use of this method ensures that the
autonomous background thread and the main robot thread (running teleop
code) will not coexist, which would cause indeterminate runtime
behaviour.

=== Controls (ca.team3161.lib.utils.controls)
Interfaces and implementations for controllers for human operators to use

==== Gamepad
An interface defining a physical gamepad type controller. These are
expected to have two thumbsticks, a directional pad, and an assortment
of buttons. They may have additional functionality as well, but this
is the minimal set. The thumbsticks' Y-axes may optionally be inverted.
Gamepad implementations, such as LogitechDualAction and
LogitechAttack3, are actually a type of Subsystem, and as such can
be used in a more 'declarative' fashion than you may be accustomed to.
Using the 'bind' or 'map' methods of a Gamepad, along with 'enableBindings'
and 'disableBindings', it is possible to have button presses and control
stick movements on your gamepad trigger events on your robot, without
having to manually check the state of each button and stick in
teleopPeriodic, for example. See the main robot class in
link:http://github.com/FRC3161/Fenrir[Fenrir] for an example.

==== LogitechDualAction
A Gamepad implementation modelling the Logitech DualAction USB gamepad.
In addition to the methods required by the Gamepad interface, this
class offers convenience methods to check the "bumpers" and "triggers"
(shoulder buttons) on the controller.

==== LogitechAttack3
A Gamepad implementation modelling the Logitech Attack 3 USB Joystick.
In addition to the methods required by the Gamepad interface, this
class offers deadzone filtering, can be inverted, etc.

==== AbstractController
An abstract base class for concrete implementations, modelling real-world
gamepad or joystick controllers, to build upon.

==== JoystickMode
Represents various functions and input curve shaping which can be applied to
joystick values from actual joystick controllers, or thumbsticks on gamepads.

==== CubedJoystickMode
A JoystickMode which applies the cubing function (x -> x\^3) to its inputs.

==== InvertedJoystickMode
A JoystickMode which simply inverts its inputs.

==== LinearJoystickMode
A JoystickMode which does nothing, just returns its inputs.

==== SquaredJoystickMode
A JoystickMode which applies the squaring function (x -> x\^2) to its inputs.

==== SquareRootedJoystickMode
A JoystickMode which applies the square rooting function (x -> x\^1/2) to
its inputs.

==== DeadbandJoystickMode
A JoystickMode which applies a configurable deadzone to its inputs. Any
input whose absolute value is less than the deadband value is rounded down to 0.

=== General utilities (ca.team3161.lib.utils)
Assertions, PWM value validation, floating point rounding, etc.

==== Assert
Assertions. Contains static methods which take a boolean condition and
throw an exception if these conditions do not hold. Useful for debugging
and during development.

==== Utils
PWM value 'normalization' (truncating into the range [-1.0, 1.0]),
non-negativity assertions, and other small snippets of code.

==== ComposedComponent
Classes which implement ComposedComponent do so to indicate that this is a
"virtual" component, wrapped around some other type of component, which may also
be virtual. At some point however, there should be a "concrete" component. An
example of a "virtual" component might be a RampingSpeedController, in which case
its composed, concrete component might be a Talon or a Victor.

=== PID (ca.team3161.lib.robot.pid)
PID control libraries. If you don't know what PID is or what it's for,
take a look at link:http://team3161.ca/teamresources/[Team 3161's Resources] page.

==== PIDSrc
An interface representing a sensor used for PID control. Encoders, Gyros,
   Potentiometers, Accelerometers, and Rangefinders are examples of backing
   sensors that can be usefully wrapped by a class implementing PIDSrc.

==== PIDAngleValueSrc
A PIDSrc which returns values as angles.

==== PIDRateValueSrc
A PIDSrc which returns values as rates.

==== PIDRawValueSrc
A PIDSrc which returns values as some other, 'raw' type (ex. potentiometer
voltage).

==== PID
A PID loop, which uses a PIDSrc and a set of constants to iteratively
determine output values with which a system can reach and maintain a
target value.

WARNING: Using PID control rather than operator control places the physical
safety and wellbeing of your robot and anybody near it in the hands of
the correctness of your PID system. Please ensure that your constants are
the correct sign (positive vs negative) and of reasonable order (start very,
very small) before using a PID-controlled system.

==== AbstractPID
An abstract base class for concrete PID implementations to build upon.

WARNING: Using PID control rather than operator control places the physical
safety and wellbeing of your robot and anybody near it in the hands of
the correctness of your PID system. Please ensure that your constants are
the correct sign (positive vs negative) and of reasonable order (start very,
very small) before using a PID-controlled system.

==== SimplePID
A simple PID implementation with no frills or fancy features.

WARNING: Using PID control rather than operator control places the physical
safety and wellbeing of your robot and anybody near it in the hands of
the correctness of your PID system. Please ensure that your constants are
the correct sign (positive vs negative) and of reasonable order (start very,
very small) before using a PID-controlled system.

==== PIDulum
A PID loop for the specific application of an inverted pendulum system.
This works the same as a standard PID, but with an additional "Feed
Forward" term, which is used to compensate for gravity pulling on the
pendulum.

WARNING: Using PID control rather than operator control places the physical
safety and wellbeing of your robot and anybody near it in the hands of
the correctness of your PID system. Please ensure that your constants are
the correct sign (positive vs negative) and of reasonable order (start very,
very small) before using a PID-controlled system.

==== EncoderRatePIDSrc
A PIDRateValueSrc which provides its rates by measuring the rotational
rate of an encoder.

==== EncoderTicksPIDSrc
A PIDSrc which provides an integer value by measuring the rotations of
an encoder.

==== GyroRatePIDSrc
A PIDRateValueSrc which provides its rates by measuring the rotational
rate of a gyroscope.

==== GyroAnglePIDSrc
A PIDAngleValueSrc which provides an angle value representing the current
rotational offset as measured by a gyroscope.

==== PotentiometerVoltagePIDSrc
An AnglePIDSrc that uses two known points (voltage, angle) of a rotary
potentiometer and is able to then convert measured voltages into
corresponding angles. Generally the two known points will be the
endpoints of the degrees of freedom of whatever system this sensor
is monitoring. The angles are arbitrarily defined by the user, and
all returned angles will simply scale between these end points, so long
as the arbitrarily defined endpoint angles have correctly measured
corresponding voltages.

WARNING: Be absolutely sure that you have correctly measured and entered
the range of motion endpoints of your physical system. Depending on
the potentiometer you use and the way it is mounted, your "higher angle"
may actually have a lower voltage. This is not a problem and you should
not try to correct it by swapping the voltages between endpoints when you
instantiate a PotentiometerPidSrc, as this would result in your system
moving in reverse.

==== RampingSpeedController
A SpeedController implementation which wraps around another SpeedController
and provides functionality to limit the maximum rate of change of this
speed controller - in other words, adding velocity ramps.

==== VelocityController
A SpeedController implementation which combines another SpeedController
(for example, a Jaguar) with an Encoder and some parameters about the
speed of the robot drivetrain. When set to 0.5, for example, the
VelocityController will then use a PID loop to attempt to dynamically
set Jaguar output so that the Encoder reads 50% of maximal rotational
speed.

=== Robot subsystems (ca.team3161.lib.robot.subsystem)
Higher level components and control systems defining major pieces of
a robot.

==== ResourceTracker
A system allowing Subsystems to safely operate concurrently without
using the same resources (such as SpeedControllers, sensors, relays)
and being interrupted by other subsystems. Any Subsystem will, before
running its task, attempt to acquire all resources listed using
require() in its defineResources() method. If any of these resources
cannot be acquired in a timely fashion, the task skips this iteration
and retries again later. If only a subset of its required resources were
acquired, or if the task successfully runs, then it releases all
resources until its next run. Resources may fail to be required if
they are currently held by other running Subsystem tasks.

==== Subsystem
Subsystems are objects that model major physical component subsystems
on robots. Subsystems have a list of required resources and a task
that they run in the background. This task can be run once or
periodically. If being run periodically, the wait time between iterations
is configurable. A Subsystem might be given references to, or contain
instances of, PID objects and SpeedControllers, and could then be
used to implement PID-controlled driving, without having to rely
on using any timers or explicitly writing any looping behaviour to
iteratively calculate PID targets. Subsystem is an abstract class
and so a Subsystem's actual concrete behaviour can vary greatly
between different subclasses.

WARNING: Failure to require() the correct resources in
defineResources() may lead to concurrency issues and indeterminate
behaviour. Ensure that all of your Subsystems require() all of their
resources.

==== AbstractSubsystem
An abstract base class implementing the shared behaviour of all
subsystems.

==== AbstractIndependentSubsystem
An abstract base class implementing the shared behaviour of all
subsystems whose tasks are run in an independent, separate thread
from all other subsystems.

==== AbstractPooledSubsystem
An abstract base class implementing the shared behaviour of all
subsystems whose tasks are run in a threadpool. Compared to an
independent subsystem this conserves system resources, but may exhibit
longer and/or less consistent latency between task runs in some situations.

==== OneShotIndependentSubsystem
A subsystem whose task is run only once per invocation of "start",
on a separate independent thread.

==== OneShotPooledSubsystem
A subsystem whose task is run only once per invocation of "start",
on a shared thread with all other pooled subsystems.

==== RepeatingIndependentSubsystem
A subsystem whose task is run periodically on a separate, independent thread.

==== RepeatingPooledSubsystem
A subsystem whose task is run periodically on a shared thread with all
other pooled subsystems. This is typically the most used type of subsystem.

=== Utils (ca.team3161.lib.robot.utils)
Robot-side utilities.

==== ChassisParameters
A class used to hold information about the physical parameters of a robot,
such as wheelbase length and encoder-shaft-to-gear-ratio.

=== Drivetrains (ca.team3161.lib.robot.motion.drivetrains)
Drivetrain components.

==== AbstractDrivetrainBase
An abstract base class which defines a Drivetrain as a Subsystem,
with one additional action: stopping the drivetrain completely,
which is intended to stop all motor controllers managed by the
drivetrain.

==== Drivetrains
A class containing static helper methods to get instances of various
drivetrain implementations.

==== SpeedControllerGroup
A container object which groups heterogenous SpeedControllers and
allows them to be managed as a unit. For example, a robot might use
two Victors and two Talons to control its drive motors. Two
SpeedControllerGroup objects could then be constructed, each controlling one
side of the robot, and managing one Victor and one Talon. These
SpeedControllerGroup objects can then be used in the robot code in the same
manner as a Talon or Victor would be, but now only one method call
needs to be performed rather than two for each change required to
each side of the robot's drive controllers.

==== PIDDrivetrain
A drivetrain controller that uses PID objects and is able to accurately
drive straight and turn by degrees. In particular, two
SpeedController instances are controlled, with two Encoders used to
measure travelled distance, and a Gyro used to ensure a straight course
while driving. The Gyro can also be used to orient the robot to face
a specific direction.

==== TankDrivetrain
A simple drivetrain which simply manages two SpeedControllers and manages
them as the left-side and right-side of the robot, using left and right
rate targets.

==== MecanumDrivetrain
A more advanced drivetrain which manages four SpeedControllers, one on
each corner of the robot, and an optional gyroscope. This provides mecanum
drive mechanics using forward, strafe, and rotational rate targets.

=== Motion tracking (ca.team3161.lib.robot.motion.tracking)
Classes which can be used for tracking the motion of the robot around the
field.

==== AbstractPositionEstimator
An abstract base upon which other position estimators can be built. Allows
integration of sensors, gyroscopes, and accelerometers, along with physical
characteristics of the robot chassis, producing an estimated total
displacement from the initial position of the robot.

==== MecanumPositionEstimator
A position estimator for robots using a mecanum drive configuration.

==== SkidSteerPositionEstimator
A position estimator for robots using a skid steer drive configuration.
